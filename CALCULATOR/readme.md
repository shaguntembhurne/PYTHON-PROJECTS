# Advanced Calculator with GUI

This is a simple yet powerful calculator application built using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SymPy for mathematical evaluations. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and evaluates expressions dynamically.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Expression evaluation with real-time result calculation.
- Clear button to reset the input.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python)
- SymPy library (for evaluating mathematical expressions)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-calculator.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install sympy
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

2. The GUI window will open. Use the buttons to enter numbers and operators, and click "=" to evaluate the result.

## Code Explanation

- **GUI**: Tkinter is used to create a basic calculator layout with buttons for numbers, operations, and an input field.
- **Expression Evaluation**: The `sympify` function from the SymPy library is used to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **Error Handling**: If the user enters an invalid expression, the calculator will display "error".

## Example

When you press the buttons "7", "+", "3", and then "=", the result `10` will appear on the screen.
